wowcpa
======

Javascript (Node) console program that provides command-line access to the World of Warcraft Community Public API.  
Documentation for the WoW CPA is here: http://blizzard.github.io/api-wow-docs/

Basic Usage
-----------
The most basic use of the program is to perform a general query and print the results to the console.
When used this way the URL and common prefix of the api may be omitted.  For example, to query info about
recipe #33994 via a brower you would need the full URL: http://us.battle.net/api/wow/recipe/33994 

Using wowcpa you would only include 'recipe/33994' as shown in the following example.  
<samp>node wowcpa.js recipe/33994  
Result:  
{"id":33994,"name":"Enchant Gloves - Precise Strikes","profession":"Enchanting","icon":"spell_holy
_greaterheal"}</samp>  

The result of the query is printed to the console.  Sometimes query results can be very long.  Wowcpa
truncates long output to the first 200 characters as shown below.

<samp>node wowcpa.js realm/status
Result:  
{"realms":[{"type":"pvp","population":"medium","queue":false,"wintergrasp":{"area":1,"controlling-
faction":0,"status":0,"next":1383676922726},"tol-barad":{"area":21,"controlling-faction":0,"status
":0 ...</samp>  

To save the full results of long queries, use the "-fo" command line switch to direct the results into a file.

<samp>node wowcpa.js -fo results.json realm/status  
Result save to: results.json</samp>  

In this case the file 'results.json' written to the current working directory would contain the full JSON text showing
the status of all realms.  (WOW CPA queries return JSON strings, so json is a good file extension to use, but you 
can supply any file name.) 

Results sent to a file are formatted to be more readable.  Returning to the recipe example again, here's 
what the results of that query look like when written to a file:

<samp> node wowcpa.js -fo recipe33994.json recipe/33994  
Result save to: recipe33994.json  
cat recipe33994.json  
{  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": 33994,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Enchant Gloves - Precise Strikes",  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"profession": "Enchanting",  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"icon": "spell_holy_greaterheal"  
}</samp>

2318
</samp>  

- <samp>
node wowcpa.js -ah Smolderthorn  
AH snapshot for Smolderthorn saved to: json/ah-Smolderthorn.json
</samp>  


user-data.json
--------------
Some commands either require or can make use of a file containing static data about the user.  See the provided
sample, user-data.json, and customize it to suit your main character.  


Notes:
------
- Only one command may be used at a time.
- There is no error checking at the moment.  I've noticed that some queries, like -ah, seem to fail often.  Just
retry a few times and it will eventually work.
- The -petlist and particularly the -itemlist commands can take a while to complete.  On the bright side the returned 
information should not change very often, so once you've run them once to create the output files you shouldn't have 
to run them again except as new patches and/or releases of WoW occur.
- This is my first javascript program.  As such it is rather thrown together and disorganized, and no doubt
the coding practice is somewhat unusual, if not downright scandalous.  (Forewarned is forearmed.)
